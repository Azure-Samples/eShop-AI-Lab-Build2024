Learn how to easily integrate AI into your .NET apps

## Introduction

Hello!

Welcome to Build Lab 342 - Learn how to easily integrate AI into your .NET apps. In this Lab, you are going to learn how to make integrations between a current existing App with Azure AI and AI services. We are thrilled to guide you through the process of enhancing your applications with the power of artificial intelligence, all of this using the incredible [eShop template](https://github.com/dotnet/eshop)!

In this lab, you will:

- Understand how to implement **Azure OpenAI** and **Semantic Kernel** from scratch, gaining a deep understanding of these powerful tools.
- Dive into the **eShop sample code**, exploring its intricacies and learning how to interact with it effectively.
- Discover how to incorporate an **Intelligent Chat feature** into your applications using Aspire and Blazor, enhancing user engagement and experience.

For this hands-on lab, we have prepared the following environment for you:

- **Azure OpenAI Service**
  - An instance for text generation, featuring GPT 3.5 or a newer model.
  - An instance to generate our Embeddings, utilizing Text Embedding Ada 002 or a newer model.
- **Development Tools**
  - Visual Studio equipped with .NET 8 and .NET Aspire.
  - Git, for version control and collaborative development.
  - Docker, to manage messaging with RabbitMQ, Redis, PgVector and Postgres.
  - Azure Developer CLI.

Whether you choose to follow along in the lab or prefer to explore at your own pace locally, we’ve got you covered.
